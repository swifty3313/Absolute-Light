Design and create a website based on the description: Absolute Light sponsors transformational events that can inspire you to embrace your own personal power; integrate body, mind, and spirit; connect with loved ones who have passed; and enhance health, wellbeing, and happiness. Each event features gifted healers, psychics, mediums, astrologers, and other types of holistic practitioners, along with exceptional products and services to support enhanced physical, emotional, or spiritual health.  ​  The founder, Terri Steele, created Absolute Light in 2020 to bridge the gap between those with a desire for personal transformation or healing and the talented readers and vendors who offer exceptional products and services. Terri has been in the holistic health field for many years and has built connections with a diversity of fascinating and effective healers and practitioners.    ​  Absolute Light sponsors both in-person and virtual programs.  The in-person programs are offered in the Lafayette, Indiana area.  The virtual programs are offered using the zoom online platform.    ​
